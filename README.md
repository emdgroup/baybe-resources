# Tutorials and Resources for BayBE

This repository contains some tutorials and general resources for the usage of [BayBE](https://github.com/emdgroup/baybe), the Bayesian Optimization Framework developed by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.

NOTE: This repository is still work-in-progress, and the resources and tutorials here can and will change significantly over time.

## How to use

This repository contains [marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks demonstrating the capabilities of BayBE.
Marimo is an open-source reactive notebook for Python.

To view and use any of the notebooks, execute `marimo edit path/to/notebook.py`. This opens `marimo` in your
browser and enables you to run and execute the notebook.

## Installation

1. Create a python environment using a version of python compatible with BayBE, e.g. via
```
mamba create --yes --name baybe-resources python=3.10
mamba activate baybe-resources
```
2. Install the additional dependencies from `requirements.txt` via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Depending on which example you want to investigate, you might need to install the additional dependencies in the corresponding folders.
